# Sentiment Analysis on Steam Reviews

This project focuses on the online gaming storefront Steam and its review system. Our goal with the dataset was to create a model using sentiment analysis that can automatically detect whether a user's review of a game is positive or negative based on language alone. We used heavy feature selection, such as bag of words and weighing certain features. Then, we ran a classification model to categorize incoming reviews into positive or negative. This allows the review system to be more automatic and better show what the general consensus is about a particular game.
